# Bandit Challenge Repository

Hello! This is my personal repository where I solve and document my progress through the Bandit wargame from OverTheWire, a platform designed to teach the basics of cybersecurity.

### What is Bandit?
Bandit is a beginner-friendly wargame that provides a series of challenges designed to introduce the essentials of cybersecurity. It's perfect for anyone starting out and wanting to learn more about the field.

### Repository Purpose

- **Personal Growth:** This repository serves as a record of my cybersecurity journey.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** While this is a personal log, I hope my experiences can help or inspire others on a similar path.

### My Approach
- **Respect the Game:** I adhere to OverTheWire's guidelines to ensure a fair and respectful playing field.
